# üìê Roof Measurement Tool - User Guide

## Overview
The Roof Measurement Tool is a Chrome extension that allows you to accurately measure roof dimensions directly from satellite imagery on Google Maps and Bing Maps. It calculates ground area, roof area with pitch adjustment, shingle squares needed, and provides cost estimates.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Installation
1. Download the extension files
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the extension folder
5. The extension icon (üìê) will appear in your Chrome toolbar

### 2. First Use
1. Navigate to **Google Maps** (`maps.google.com`) or **Bing Maps** (`bing.com/maps`)
2. Search for the property you want to measure
3. Switch to **Satellite view** for best results
4. Click the extension icon in your toolbar

## üìè How to Measure a Roof

### Step 1: Position the Map
- Zoom in until you can clearly see the roof edges
- Ensure the entire roof is visible in your viewport
- Rotate the map if needed to get the best angle

### Step 2: Start Measurement
1. Click the **"Start Roof Measurement"** button in the popup
2. The extension will activate measurement mode
3. You'll see a blue overlay appear on the map

### Step 3: Mark Roof Corners
1. **Click on each corner** of the roof in sequence
   - Start at one corner and work clockwise or counterclockwise
   - Click precisely on the roof edge where it meets the walls
2. **Minimum 3 points** required for area calculation
3. **Recommended 4+ points** for complex roof shapes
4. **Auto-completion**: After 4+ points, measurement will auto-finish

### Step 4: Review Results
- **Ground Area**: The flat area as seen from above
- **Roof Area**: Adjusted for roof pitch/slope
- **Shingle Squares**: Number of squares needed (1 square = 100 sq ft)
- **Material Cost**: Estimated cost range for shingles

## ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Options

### Roof Type Selection
- **Gable**: Traditional peaked roof with two sloping sides
- **Hip**: All sides slope downward to walls
- **Shed**: Single sloping plane
- **Flat**: Minimal slope (use 0:12 pitch)

### Roof Pitch Adjustment
- **4:12 (Low)**: Gentle slope, easier installation
- **6:12 (Medium)**: Standard residential pitch
- **8:12 (Steep)**: More complex installation
- **12:12 (Very Steep)**: Requires special safety measures

### Construction Year
- Enter the year the roof was built
- Helps estimate remaining roof life
- Shows age category: New, Good, Aging, or Consider replacement

## üí° Pro Tips

### For Best Accuracy
- **Zoom level**: Use the highest zoom that shows the entire roof
- **Multiple measurements**: Take 2-3 measurements and average
- **Complex roofs**: Break into sections and measure separately
- **Shadow analysis**: Use shadows to estimate roof pitch visually

### Common Roof Types & Pitches
| Roof Style | Typical Pitch | Notes |
|------------|---------------|--------|
| Ranch | 4:12 - 6:12 | Simple gable design |
| Colonial | 6:12 - 8:12 | Traditional peaked roof |
| Modern | 0:12 - 3:12 | Often flat or low-slope |
| Victorian | 8:12 - 12:12 | Steep, complex shapes |

## üìä Understanding Results

### Measurements Explained
- **Ground Area**: The footprint of the roof as seen from satellite
- **Roof Area**: Actual surface area including slope
- **Shingle Squares**: Industry standard (100 sq ft = 1 square)
- **Material Cost**: Includes 10% waste allowance

### Cost Estimates
- **Asphalt shingles**: $150/square (basic 3-tab)
- **Architectural shingles**: $200/square (dimensional)
- **Premium shingles**: $350/square (designer/architectural)

### Roof Age Categories
- **New**: 0-5 years
- **Good**: 5-15 years
- **Aging**: 15-25 years
- **Consider replacement**: 25+ years

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Working
- **Check site**: Ensure you're on Google Maps or Bing Maps
- **Refresh page**: Reload the map page
- **Check permissions**: Extension needs access to maps sites

### Measurement Issues
- **Points not registering**: Click more precisely on roof edges
- **Wrong area**: Check that you clicked all corners in order
- **Scale seems off**: Try zooming in/out and remeasuring

### Data Not Saving
- **Storage limit**: Extension keeps last 50 measurements
- **Browser settings**: Ensure Chrome storage is enabled

## üìÅ Managing Measurements
