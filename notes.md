I've created a comprehensive Chrome extension for roof measurements. Here's what the extension includes:

## Core Features

**1. Manifest & Structure**
- Chrome Extension Manifest V3 compatible
- Supports Google Maps and Bing Maps
- Proper permissions for measurement functionality

**2. Interactive Measurement Tool**
- Click-to-measure interface on satellite maps
- Visual overlay with measurement points and area highlighting
- Real-time calculation of roof dimensions

**3. Roof Calculations**
- Ground area measurement using shoelace formula
- Roof pitch estimation and adjustment
- Shingle squares calculation (industry standard: 1 square = 100 sq ft)
- Material cost estimation

**4. Advanced Features**
- Roof age estimation based on construction year
- Multiple roof types support (gable, hip, shed, etc.)
- Adjustable pitch calculations
- Measurement history storage

## How It Works

1. **Navigate** to Google Maps or Bing Maps
2. **Click** the extension icon and select "Start Roof Measurement"
3. **Click** on the corners of the roof to define the area
4. **Finish** measurement to get calculations for:
   - Ground area and roof area
   - Required shingle squares
   - Estimated material costs
   - Roof age assessment

## Key Calculations

- **Roof Area**: Ground area × √(1 + (rise/run)²)
- **Shingle Squares**: Roof area ÷ 100 sq ft
- **Material Costs**: Based on current market rates with waste factor

## Installation Steps

1. Save each file with the appropriate extension (.html, .js, .css, .json)
2. Load as unpacked extension in Chrome Developer Mode
3. Navigate to supported map sites to begin measuring

## Limitations & Future Enhancements

**Current Limitations:**
- Scale detection relies on map interface elements
- Pitch estimation may need manual adjustment
- Limited to satellite view accuracy

**Potential Enhancements:**
- Integration with county assessor databases
- Machine learning for automatic roof type detection
- Shadow analysis for pitch calculation
- Building permit data integration
- Professional report generation

The extension provides a solid foundation for roof measurements with room for enhanced accuracy through additional data sources and computer vision improvements.
